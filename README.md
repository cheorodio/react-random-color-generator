# React.js Random Color Generator

## About the Project 📚
This is an upLeveled bootcamp project that challenges me to design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when the generate button is clicked. In addition, a user can type a hue and/or lightness in the input fields to generate their own random color.

## Technologies ⚛️
I used React to develop this project

## Setup 💻
- Download or clone the repository
- Run `pnpm start`
  - This runs the app in the development mode.
  - Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
  - The page will reload when you make changes.
  
## Approach 🚶🏻‍♀️
First, I created a todo list to organise my way of tackling this project. The todo list as follows:
- [x] Design prototype on Figma
- [x] Make project skeleton on JSX, include the following:
  - [x] Title
  - [x] Button to generate the color
  - [x] Div box for the color with a text box inside for the HEX code and call this `Generated Color: <HEX code>`
  - [x] Input fields for both hue and lightness
  - [x] Button to reset the input fields
- [x] Add library to generate random color
- [x] useStates for random color, hue and luminosity
- [x] function for the button to work for when a user clicks on it
- [x] function for the color container box so it changes its color every click of the button, same for the text box of HEX color
- [x] Input fields should have a function that accept hue and luminosity
- [x] Create a function for reset button to return to initial state when clicked

## Credits 📝
This is the first React project that I did at [upLeveled](https://upleveled.io/) bootcamp as part of the Spring '23 cohort.
